# **My names Josh, aka IsGeo or IsXGeo**

## **A few goals I have in mind**

- Attain some level of c# competency

## **Stuff I know and love**

**Python** (Py3)

I love python because it is so easy to draft and wrap your head around things. It wasn't my first language but I sure wish it was!

**Java**

I have a little experience with java from coding a few minecraft plugins for fun. Not super intense or in-depth but still enjoy the language. It was also the first language I really dove into.

**C#** with **Unity** and **Godot**

C# is so far my favourite language simply because I found that it had some similarites to java which made it very easy to adapt to. It is also the language I am actively learning at the moment.
